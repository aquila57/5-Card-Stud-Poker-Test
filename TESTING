in this repository.

Read REFERENCES for information about the 5 card stud poker test.

--------

Program by program testing instructions.

Fibonacci random number generator

Run fibostud to apply the 5 card stud poker test to the fibonacci
random number generator.  There are no parameters.

./fibostud

This program is expected to fail the test.

--------

64 bit LFSR random number generator

Run lfsrstud to apply the 5 card stud poker test to the 64 bit
LFSR random number generator.  There are no parameters.

./lfsrstud

This program is expected to fail the test.

--------

32 bit RANDU random number generator

Run rustud to apply the 5 card stud poker test to the 32 bit
RANDU random number generator.  There are no parameters.

./rustud

This program is expected to fail the test.

--------

Sine wave random number generator

Run randu to apply the 5 card stud poker test to the sine wave
random number generator.  There are no parameters.

./sinestud

This program is expected to fail the test.

--------

eegl64 random number generator

Run 5cdstud to apply the 5 card stud poker test to the eegl64
uniform random number generator.  There are no parameters.

./5cdstud

This program is expected to pass the test.

--------

etaus random number generator

Run etausstud to apply the 5 card stud poker test to the etaus
uniform random number generator.  There are no parameters.

./etausstud

This program is expected to pass the test.

--------

GNU Scientific Library random number generators

Run tstgsl.sh to apply the 5 card stud poker test to the GNU
Scientific Library collection of random number generators.
There is one parameter, the name of the GSL generator.

./tstgsl.sh RNG_name 

Example,

./tstgsl.sh taus2

This example runs the 5 card stud poker test on the GSL taus2
random number generator.

To find a list of valid GSL random number generators, enter
a parameter that produces an error.

./tstgsl.sh ?

This test is expected to pass the test except for three
generators.

random64-glibc2

random64-libc5

randu

To run a test of all GSL generators, run runall.sh.

./runall.sh

Read the results of this test by browsing allgsl.out.
This test reads allgsl.lst as an input file.

--------

Dieharder package random number generators

Run tstdie.sh to apply the 5 card stud poker test to the
dieharder collection of random number generators.  There is
one parameter, the id of the dieharder generator.

./tstdie.sh RNG_number

Example,

./tstdie.sh 053

This example runs the 5 card stud poker test on the dieharder
taus2 random number generator.

To find a list of valid dieharder random number generators,
enter the following dieharder command.

dieharder -g -l

This test is expected to pass the test except for the uni
generator.

To run a test of all dieharder generators, run dieall.sh.

./dieall.sh

Read the results of this test by browsing alldie.out.
This test reads alldie.lst as an input file.
